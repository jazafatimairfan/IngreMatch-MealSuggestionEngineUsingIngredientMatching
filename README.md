new repository

Project Overview:
The Meal Suggestion Engine is an application that recommends meals based on the ingredients provided by the user. Instead of searching recipes manually, users can enter the ingredients they have, and the system suggests suitable meals by matching those ingredients with a recipe database.
This project focuses on ingredient matching logic and aims to reduce food waste while making meal planning quick and convenient.

Objectives:
Suggest meals based on user-entered ingredients
Minimize food waste by utilizing available ingredients
Provide quick and relevant meal recommendations
Offer a simple and user-friendly interface
Create a base for future AI/ML-based enhancements

Features:
User input for available ingredients
Ingredient-based meal matching
Displays relevant meal suggestions
Clean and responsive user interface
Modular and scalable project structure

How It Works:
The user enters a list of available ingredients.
The system compares the input ingredients with a predefined recipe dataset.
Meals with the highest ingredient match are identified.
Matching meals are displayed as suggestions to the user.
The matching process is based on string comparison and similarity scoring to ensure accurate results.
